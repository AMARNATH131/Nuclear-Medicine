\textbf{\large Abstract}:\\ \\ \large Immunotherapy by using immune checkpoint inhibitors is a revolutionary development in
oncology. Medical imaging is also impacted by this new therapy, particularly nuclear medicine
imaging (also called radionuclide imaging), which uses radioactive tracers to visualize metabolic
functions. Our aim was to review the current applications of nuclear medicine imaging in
immunotherapy, along with their limitations, and the perspectives offered by this imaging
modality.\\ \\

\noindent
\textbf{\large Introduction:} \\ \\ Cancers are a proliferation of abnormal cells that can have the ability to disrupt the host’s
adaptive immune response to avoid a control by tumoricidal attack. This process can be
overcome by immunotherapy, which aims to stimulate the body’s immune system against cancer
cells.
Immunotherapy may be broken down into three main families. Firstly, passive cancer
immunotherapy, which consists of the use of antibodies directed against tumor proteins, or
adoptive T-cell therapy targeting a tumor receptor; secondly, active immunotherapy involving
cytokines and vaccines; thirdly, immunomodulatory therapy including immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICI) and targeting, more specifically, the tumor microenvironment.
Immunotherapy using ICI—notably anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4),
anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1), and anti-PDL-1 (PD1 ligand) antibodies—is a
recent successful therapeutic approach that reactivates the immune system against cancers. In a
meta-analysis combining 19 studies involving 11,640 patients treated by ICI or other drugs, a
team observed that a durable response (i.e. a progression-free survival exceeding three times the
median progression-free survival of the whole population) occurred for 25% of the patients
treated by ICI, which is a far better rate when compared to other drug classes (11%). However, as
the therapeutic approach of ICI is different from usual cytotoxic approaches—notably by
generating inflammations rather than direct lysis—medical imaging has to be interpreted
differently than when using cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Thus, ICI introduces new challenges in medical imaging. Pre-therapeutic examinations
have to identify prognostic factors—linked, for example, to the extent and the burden of the
disease—as well as predictive factors of the response to immunotherapy, since it is known that
not all patients will benefit from immunotherapy. New imaging techniques, called immunoimaging, target tumor or inflammatory cell and are promising for this indication. Concerning
therapeutic evaluation, follow-up examinations must allow the detection of non-responders; in
order to change the therapeutic line, this detection has to be done early, particularly in cases of
hyper progression—which is an acceleration of tumor growth rate sometimes observed after
starting immunotherapy. At the same time, to avoid the premature discontinuation of treatment
beneficial to the patient, a real disease progression should not be confused with a
pseudoprogression, which is an increase in the size of lesions, or the visualization of new lesions,
followed by a response. Finally, end-of-treatment examinations should allow patients to safely
stop immunotherapy in the event of durable response.
These challenges concern morphological and anatomical imaging, including computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. However, they also
concern functional imaging, particularly nuclear medicine imaging.
To produce images, nuclear medicine uses radiotracers, which are a combination of a
radioactive atom and a tracer targeting a metabolic function. These radionuclide images can be
produced by detecting in vivo radiotracers with, in case of gamma (γ) radioactivity, a gamma
camera (used notably to create a 3D single photon emission computed tomography, alias
SPECT), or with, in case of a positron (β+) radioactivity, positron emission tomography (PET),
which is usually coupled with a CT to form a PET/CT.
As morphological modifications, functional modifications due to ICI are visible on
nuclear medicine images and must be known not only by nuclear physicians but also by
oncologists requesting examinations. In addition, nuclear medicine, by its high lability and
sensitivity, can offer many solutions, now and in the future, for the new challenges raised by ICI.
The objective of this review is to conduct a systematic review of the articles concerning
nuclear medicine and ICI, with a summary of the pathophysiology and a focus on changes
already made in the current clinical routine and those to come.
\\ \noindent
\\ \textbf{\large MATERIAL AND METHODS::}

\noindent \\A literature review was performed using Medline (PubMed). The research was conducted
in jan 2022 to identify articles published between 2008 and 2019 with a search key combining
date of publication and MeSH terms linked to immunotherapy, nuclear medicine and medical
imaging. Search results were judged for relevance using the title, abstract, and full text for
inclusion in the analysis.

\noindent 
\\ \\ \textbf{\large PHYSIOPATHOLOGY:}
\\\\F-FDG, exploring glucose metabolism, is the main PET radiotracer used in nuclear
medicine imaging. However, F-FDG is not specific to tumor cells and also targets immune cells.
Since immunotherapy works by inducing an inflammatory response, it is therefore difficult to
differentiate F-FDG uptakes related to tumor cells from those due to inflammation. To overcome
this limitation, an understanding of the mechanisms of ICI is helpful in identifying potential new
targets for nuclear medicine imaging. The physiopathy is summarized in figure below:
\\\\

cell. Different targets can be imaged by use of several labeled antibodies (immuno-PET). These targets may be immune-checkpoints (such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
antigen 4 (CTLA-4), PD-L1, and its receptor programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)) or biomarkers of the immune response (such as interferon γ (IFNγ), granzyme
and interleukin-2 (IL2)). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), on the other hand, makes it possible to assess the expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT-1); it can
be incorporated indifferently, both in tumor and immune cells. PET: positron emission tomography

\\\\
 Cell-mediated immunity is performed by immune cells independently from circulating
antibodies. These cells are macrophages and natural killer cells from the innate system or T cells
including helper, regulatory, and killer T cells from the adaptive immune system. Among them,
cytotoxic T cells expressing CD8 as a co-receptor of T-cell receptor (TCR) cause the cell death
of tumor cells after releasing serine proteases such as granzymes. However, the cytotoxic T cell
activity is regulated and modulated by others cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) and regulatory T cells expressing CD4.
The cytotoxic T cell allows an immune response against tumor cells. The specificity of
the immune response is driven by the interaction between cells expressing major
histocompatibility complex receptor (MHC) and TCR. Briefly, major histocompatibility complex
class I (MHC-I), displaying an antigen from tumor cells, will be recognized by the TCR of a
cytotoxic T cell. However, co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory signals regulate this immune
response. Co-stimulatory signals such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon γ (IFNγ) improve the
immune response against foreign antigens. On the contrary, the co-inhibitory signals alleviate the
immune response to allow self-tolerance. Thus, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on the membrane
surface of tumor cells are recognized by PD-1 of the cytotoxic T cell, and this leads to stopping
the immune response. Moreover, if CTLA-4 expressed by regulatory T cells binds to B7
expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), the immune response declines.
The signals shared between tumor cells, T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the
tumor microenvironment, due to the interaction of their ligand–receptor pairs, are known as
immune checkpoints. The tumor cells that release and/or express mediators of immune
suppression, such as PD-L1 and PD-L2, have a chance to proliferate by inhibiting the immune
response.
The pharmacology of ICIs is based on the reactivation of the immune response against
tumors rather than a direct effect on tumor cells. The ICIs are only monoclonal antibodies
targeting and blocking the co-inhibitory signals of either programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)—which are cytotoxic T cell surface
receptors—or a ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) from tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. These
molecules are used in the oncologic field and harness the immune system to help to fight tumor
cells.\\


\\ \\ \noindent
\textbf{\large MEDICAL IMAGING: BASELINE EXAMINATION:
} \\ \\ If the response to ICIs seems better compared to other drug classes, predictive biomarkers
to determine which patients will respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors are useful in making
the right treatment choice. Medical imaging—particularly nuclear medicine—has an essential
role to play in this field because it offers, in one examination, the possibility of characterizing
tumors that are often multifocal and cannot therefore be all biopsied.
Compared to other medical imaging modalities such as CT or MRI, nuclear medicine
imaging generally provides the advantage of a highly sensitive whole-body functional
examination, the specificity depending on the radiotracer used. The specificity can be low for a
multifunctional radiotracer (such as F-FDG, whose uptakes concern tumor and inflammatory
cells) to very high for radiotracers targeting specifically an immune cell receptor or an active
inflammatory signal (however, such radiotracers are still in development). Concerning the
disadvantages, the spatial resolution of nuclear medicine imaging is worse than CT and MRI, and
radiation protection must be taken into account. Many radiotracers are currently studied with a
summary (potential interest, name, target, development phase) presented in Table 1.It has to be noticed that the radionuclide used to label the radiotracer has to be chosen carefully.
In particular, it must be able to chemically bind to the tracer molecule either by covalent or by
coordinate bonds. The emitted radioactivity must also be adapted to the imaging method used
with the gamma (γ) ray emitter (Technetium 99mTc, Indium 111In), for the gamma camera and
positron (β+) emitter (Fluorine 18F, Copper 64Cu, Gallium 68Ga, Zirconium 89Zr) for
PET—the spatial resolution of the PET being inherently better than that of the gamma camera.
\begin{figure}

radiotracers, targets and development phase. GLUT-1: glucose transporter 1, NSCLC: non-small
cell lung carcinoma.}
  %  \label{fig:galaxy}
\end{figure}
Moreover, the radioactive half-life of the radionuclide has to be adapted to the physiological
process being explored: for short processes (a few hours), 99mTc, 18F, and 68Ga can be chosen,
but for long processes (a few days) such as those observed with antibodies, 111In, 64Cu, and
89Zr with longer radioactive periods have to be used. Finally, the deposited energy dose, which
varies according to the radionuclides and the tracers’ clearance, must be taken into account to
ensure that it is as low as possible.
4.1 18F-FDG PET/CT
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is a multifunctional PET/CT radiotracer exploring
glucose metabolism—including tumor metabolism and inflammation—and is a well-established
nuclear medicine examination performed to explore cancer, notably for the extension assessment
[14].
Beyond the extension assessment, baseline 18F-FDG total metabolic tumor volume
(TMTV), measured by segmenting all tumors on PET images, could be an interesting parameter,
as it can be easily (semi)-automatically determined, and as it presents an important prognostic
value in many cancers and treatments, including immunotherapy. Therefore, Ito et al. have
shown for 142 patients with melanoma treated by ipilimumab that the median overall survival
(OS) was significantly lower for patients with high TMTV (10.8 months 95% CI 5.9–15.8
months) than with low TMTV (26.0 months 95% CI 3.0–49.2 months) [15]. In a multivariate
analysis including TMTV and significant clinical parameters (including age and active brain
metastases), TMVT was still a significant prognostic factor. Similar results have been observed
for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) treated by ICI.
Beyond its role in the initial extension assessment, the 18F-FDG PET could also be
useful in determining the PD-1/PD-L1 status, on which the response to immunotherapy depends.
Effectively, PD-L1 promotes glycolytic metabolism in tumor cells, while this glucose
consumption by tumors metabolically restricts T cells, notably by dampening their glycolytic
capacity. As a result, PD-L1 protein expression was significantly correlated to glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, which is the transporter of 18F-FDG, in lung adenocarcinoma
[18,19] and squamous-cell carcinoma. In a meta-analysis about lung cancer including three
studies (718 patients), 18F-FDG PET SUVmax (maximal standardized uptake value reflecting
tumor activity) and PD-L1 expression were slightly correlated (Spearman’s correlation 0.36
(95% CI: 0.22; 0.50)), although this low value does not allow the SUVmax to be used as a
replacement for the PDL1 status in lung cancer. For bladder cancer, a study including 63 patients
has shown too that SUVmax was significantly higher in PD-1/PD-L1-positive patients but also
that PD-1 and PD-L1 status could be predicted using a SUVmax cut-off value of 22.7, with quite
good accuracies of 71.4% and 77.8%, respectively. It has to be added that 18F-FDG SUV is not
only significantly correlated to PD-1/PD-L1 status, but also to other biomarkers of interest when
immune-checkpoint inhibitors are considered, including CD8 tumor infiltration by lymphocytes
(TILs).
18F-FDG PET/CT could also be used to determine indirect predictive factors for
response to immunotherapy treatment. Therefore, this examination could reflect the gut
microbiota, whose analysis could be favorable to predict the treatment effect of immunotherapy,
as gut microbiota seems linked to the therapeutic response. Thus, in a retrospective pilot study
involving 14 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with ipilimumab in the first line, a team
observed that colonic, pre-therapeutic 18F-FDG PET SUVmax seems lower for responding
patients with mean SUVmax equal to 1.33 ± 0.04, 2.2 ± 0.46, and 3.33 ± 2.67 for individuals
with complete response, partial response, and progressive disease, respectively. This could be
explained by an association between low bacterial load and higher physiologic colonic 18F-FDG
uptake due to a shift in colonic metabolism from short-chain fatty acids, produced by colonic
bacteria, to glycolysis when the bacterial load is low. However, these promising preliminary
results have to be confirmed.
Another indirect predictive factor is the determination of body composition parameters
on the anatomical CT associated with the PET. Therefore, in a study including 55 patients with
NSCLC treated by nivolumab, whole-body subcutaneous fat mass measured automatically on the
CT of the PET was a significant prognostic factor with a better prognosis for fatty patients (HR =
0.75, p = 0.006 in multivariate analysis), possibly because adipocytes in the human obese
subcutaneous fat mass release several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which
contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation.
Nevertheless, 18F-FDG is not as tumor-specific as we might wish, notably for response
assessment during immunotherapy. One of the main problems with ICIs is related to the
inflammatory reactions that recall neutrophils and macrophages and activate T cells on the tumor
site. This antineoplastic activation determines the high consumption of FDG by immune cells
and, consequently, a loss of specificity for this radiotracer.
4.2 Immuno-imaging:
Despite the remarkable success of ICIs in clinical practice, the efficacy and
responsiveness of these agents vary greatly among different tumor types and across individuals.
Biomarkers determined on tumor biopsy, including PD-1 and PD-L1 measured with
immunohistochemistry (IHC), can help to select patients. However, these biomarkers are limited,
as some patients can have a response without them, while others can have no response with
them. A possible explanation is that a single biopsy may not capture the heterogeneity across
various tumor lesions in a patient or within a single lesion. Therefore, the use of radiotracers to
predict responses to immunotherapy is becoming increasingly important to better select patients,
as they have the possibility to characterize the whole tumor in a single non-invasive examination.
Among the possible methods, “immuno-PET”, combining antibodies (or antibody fragments)
with PET radionuclide (positron emitter), takes advantage of the specificity and affinity of
antibodies and the sensitivity of PET.
For immuno-PET, targets can be general T cell markers (such as CD3, CD4, and CD8),
immune checkpoints (such as PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4) or biomarkers of the immune response
(such as interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and granzyme B). The absence of impact on the functionality
of in vivo T cells also needs to be considered. Many radiotracers have been evaluated in
preclinical models, with a large “immuno-imaging toolbox” already available, but few of them
have ever been tested in clinical trials. A summary of the usable radiotracers and target is
presented in Figure 2 and in Table 1.
Among the radiotracers tested in clinical trials, antibodies targeting checkpoints
inhibitors, notably PD-1/PD-L1, have shown promising results. In a study including 22 patients
with three tumor types (bladder cancer, NSCLC, or breast cancer) with pre-therapeutic PET/CT
with 89 Zirconium-labeled atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), PET uptakes were heterogeneous and
generally high in tumors. Uptake was also high in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation.
Interestingly, progression-free survival was better correlated with the pretreatment PET signal
than with IHC-based predictive biomarkers, with, for example, a hazard ratio equal to 11.7 (95%
CI: 3.3–62.7) for PET versus 2.6 (95% CI: 0.8–13.6) for an immunohistochemistry analysis of
PD-L1 [38]. These results for the survival are possibly linked to the heterogeneity of the PD-L1
expression across different tumor localizations. Comparable results were obtained in another
study evaluating two anti-PD-1/PD-L1 radiotracers (a 18 Fluor-labeled anti-PD-L1 Adnectin and
an anti-PD-1, 89 Zirconium-labeled nivolumab) on 13 patients with advanced NSCLC. Other
PD-L1-specific radiolabeled peptides exist. Notably, the so-called “[64Cu]WL12”, which is a
14-amino acid circular peptide “WL12”, with a binding interface on PD-L1 overlapping with
PD-1 and PD-L1 therapeutics, radiolabeled with 64Cu, a positron (β+) emitter. A preclinical
study on mice has shown that this radiotracer could generate highly contrasted images within 120
minutes after the injection, which is a usual time period for conducting nuclear medicine
examinations. Moreover, this peptide could measure the PD-L1 occupancy and the
pharmacokinetics of PD-L1 immune-checkpoint inhibitor non-invasively and independently of
the type of antibody chosen for treatment.
Imaging of the biomarkers of immune response could also be interesting. Interferon-γ
(IFNγ) immuno-PET (89Zr-anti-IFN-γ) offers the possibility to explore the activated
lymphocytes inside tumors, including CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In a preclinical study, the
tumor uptake with this radiotracer seemed more specific than CD3 immuno-PET
(89Zr-anti-CD3), which targets the general T-cell population localized in the tumor but also in
other lymphoid tissues, and it could help to discern activated versus anergic/dysfunctional status.
Another interesting target of immune response could be the protease granzyme B (GZP), which
is secreted by cytotoxic CD8+ and has a key role for immune-induced apoptosis. In preclinical
tumor models, a highly specific peptide PET imaging agent for GZP was predictive of the
response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors, with high signal tumors responding to therapy and
with 93% sensitivity and 94% negative predictive value. Clinical studies have yet to be done.
Finally, a radiotracer for a gamma camera using monophotonic gamma radioactivity,
which is different from the positron (β+) radioactivity used for PET, is also possible. A study on
16 patients with NSCLC demonstrates that a 99mTc-labeled anti-PD-L1-single domain antibody
was feasible in humans safely and with acceptable dosimetry. The image acquisition was also
possible rather quickly after the injection at 2 h. However, if the ratio between the tumor uptake
and blood pool at 2 h was significantly correlated to the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (ρ = 0.68,
p = 0.014) and the uptake ratio was lower in tumors with ≤1% PD-L1 expression (1.89 versus
2.49, p = 0.048), the results seem too limited to be used in clinical practice. Another radiotracer
for a gamma camera is 99mTc-interleukin-2 (99mTc-IL2), which could be used to detect TILs
and distinguish between true progression and pseudoprogression. A pilot study has demonstrated
the safety and feasibility of 99mTc-IL2 imaging, but further studies are needed.
4.3 Radiomics and Complex Quantitative Parameters
Radiomics is a set of methods used to take advantage of medical imaging and extract
quantitative features that can characterize the tumor phenotype. A very large number of features
can be extracted (manually or automatically) from medical images (e.g., CT, MRI, PET) and then
correlated to tumor characteristics and clinical outcomes using machine learning algorithms.
In a retrospective study using four independent cohorts of patients, Sun et al. have shown
the usefulness of this method in determining the tumor infiltration by CD8 cells on
contrast-enhanced CT images and with a signature combining eight features. Despite the
relatively low area under the curve of the score for this prediction (AUC = 0.67; 95% CI
0.57–0.77), the signature was able to predict an objective response to anti-PD-1 and PD-L1
therapy, notably at 3 months (p = 0.049), as well as overall survival in univariate (median overall
survival was 24.3 months in the high radiomic score group versus 11.5 months in the low
radiomic score group; p = 0.0081) and multivariate analyses. Another study explored the interest
of radiomics as a non-invasive biomarker for responses to cancer immunotherapy on 1055
primary and metastatic lesions from 203 contrast-enhanced CTs from patients with advanced
melanoma and NSCLC, undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. They found on a lesion-based approach,
reflecting the metastatic condition, that lesions with heterogeneous density and more compact
and spherical (high volume/surface ratio) were associated with a better response. Concerning
18F-FDG PET radiomic analysis and PD-1/PD-L1 expression, a team found in 53 oropharyngeal
or hypopharyngeal cancer patients that several PET-derived textural features, describing the
organization of tumor pixels, can provide information to determine tumor PD-L1 expression in
head and neck carcinoma. However, no clear and validated textural model distinguishing high
and low PD-L1 expression is described, and more studies have yet to be done. Finally,
delta-radiomics (∆-radiomics), studying changes in radiomic features (e.g., texture within the
nodule) on serial images could be useful to assess the effectiveness of therapy as well as predict
early treatment response, but this domain has yet to be explored.
Complex quantitative parameters could be also interesting, such as compartmental
parameters describing the kinetics of radiotracers more precisely than SUV. However, such
parameters have not shown an added value compared to SUV in a population of 25 patients with
metastatic melanoma treated with immunotherapy. Therefore, further studies are still needed.\\

\\ \\\noindent  \textbf{\large  Therapeutic Evaluation:} \\ \\ 18F-FDG PET/CT is a routinely used for the examination of therapeutic evaluation of
cancers. However, ICIs, treating cancer by inducing inflammation, question its interpretation and
the time of execution, because this radiotracer presents an uptake in the case of active cancer but
also of inflammation. Comparable challenges are observed for anatomical images. Different
patterns of response according to the time of examination are shown in Figure
Figure shown below is : Pattern of response according to the size and number of the tumors and
in function of time of examination. Complete response, partial response, stable disease, and
progression are the four classical patterns of response in oncology. Concerning the atypical
responses sometimes observed with immune - checkpoint inhibitors, a dissociated response
corresponds to lesions shrinkings and others growing; pseudo progression is an initial increase in
tumor size and/or number due to inflammation followed by a decrease, and hyper progression in
an accelerated tumor growth rate after starting treating.

\\\\
5.1 Standard Therapeutic Assessment Scales:
The therapeutic evaluation of cytotoxic chemotherapy in morphological imaging is based
on the fact that increasing lesion size and/or the appearance of new lesions after treatment
indicates progression and therapeutic failure. Many therapeutic evaluation criteria exist for
morphological imaging, including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1,
which uses unidimensional single-diameter measurements. Compared to morphological imaging,
such as CT, functional imaging including 18F-FDG PET/CT can provide an earlier response
assessment. One of the situations where therapeutic assessment by functional imaging by
18F-FDG PET may be much earlier than morphological imaging is gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GISTs) treated by imatinib. While measuring anatomical responses through
morphological imaging (CT) often requires many months, 18F-FDG PET can predict responses
within one day to one week. Some therapeutic evaluation criteria exist in nuclear medicine,
including the PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) 1.0 for solid tumors and the
Lugano classification for lymphomas.
5.2 Limitations due to Atypical Tumor Response Patterns:
The therapeutic scales used to evaluate cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally based on a
classification with four patterns of response: complete response, partial response, stable disease,
or progression. However, “atypical” tumor response patterns that do not belong to these four
categories can be observed with ICIs, which makes the therapeutic evaluation of these treatments
a real challenge.
Pseudoprogression is an atypical tumor response pattern defined as an increase in the size
of lesions or the visualization of new lesions, followed by a response. This effect could be
explained by the initial T-cell tumor infiltration, with an apparent increase in the tumor burden
disconnected to the tumor cell proliferation. In studies, rates of pseudoprogression never
exceeded 10%; therefore, they stayed rare compared to effective disease progression.
Dissociated responses, observed when some lesions shrink and others grow, are another
atypical tumor response of ICIs. One study reported dissociated responses in 7.5% of NSCLC
patients treated with anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents with a better survival observed than true
progressions. Another study with 50 patients having NSCLC treated by ICI and followed by
18F-FDG PET showed that dissociated response occurred in 26% (five patients) of the 19
patients whose treatment was continued after initial progression with a clinical benefit for these
patients.
Nevertheless, due to these atypical responses, classical criteria, such as RECIST or
PERCIST, can be limited to the therapeutic assessment of immune checkpoint inhibitors; some
diseases can be classified as “progressive”, while this is the response to the treatment that occurs
[56,58].
5.3 Updated Therapeutic Assessment Scales for Immunotherapy:
To avoid a misdiagnosis in therapeutic evaluation between progressive disease and
inflammation, a modification of the scales has been proposed. In anatomical and morphological
imaging, at least four modified criteria have already been proposed: irRC (immune-related
response criteria) (2009), irRECIST (immune-related RECIST) (2013), iRECIST (immune
RECIST) (2017), and imRECIST (immune-modified RECIST) (2018). Some differences exist
between these scales, but they all have in common the need to confirm a progressive disease on a
new examination, which is usually at 4 weeks. The interest of these updated scales has been
highlighted in a study including 160 patients with NSCLC with follow up performed by
computed tomography. Patients with atypical responses, according to the iRECIST and
irRECIST, represented 11% of the RECIST 1.1 so-called progressive patients, and they had
superior overall survival compared to patients with the true disease progression.
If the increase in the size or appearance of new lesions due to pseudoprogression can
mislead the therapeutic evaluation in radiological imaging, the 18F-FDG PET metabolic
evaluation can also be misleading. Effectively, 18F-FDG is not a tumor-specific radiotracer, and
the inflammatory response, which displaces neutrophils, macrophages, and activated T cells to
the tumor site, also leads to the uptake of 18F-FDG.
Therefore, an effort has been made in nuclear medicine with modified scales proposed,
including, for solid tumors, PECRIT (PET/CT Criteria for the early prediction of Response to
Immune checkpoint inhibitor Therapy) (2017), PERCIMT (PET Response Evaluation Criteria
for Immunotherapy) (2018), imPERCIST5 (immunotherapy-modified PERCIST up to five
lesions) (2019), and iPERCIST (immune PERCIST) (2019). Table 2 resumes the proposed
criteria for therapeutic evaluation by 18F-FDG PET of solid tumors treated by immune
checkpoint inhibitors.
However, these nuclear medicine criteria are quite different, and therefore,
standardization is needed. It should be noticed that only iPERCIST introduces the need to
confirm a progressive disease such as the updated radiological criteria; however, such a control
may limit the risk of a false positive PET scan. A dissociated response is also not considered in
these scales, while it seems important as the patients experiencing these response patterns seems
to have a clinical benefit of immunotherapy. Moreover, the populations used to define these
criteria were relatively small (from 20 patients for PERCRIT to 60 patients for imPERCIST),
and studies with more patients (and, therefore, more cases of atypical tumor responses) are
needed to validate these criteria. The localization of the uptake should also be considered, as an
immune activation induced by checkpoint treatment can be observed in tumor-draining lymph
nodes that can induce an 18F-FDG uptake and be misinterpreted as progression, as seen in
Figure -
\\

node in histological analysis.}
  %  \label{fig:galaxy}
\end{figure}
\\\\
Different scales for solid tumors and hematological tumors have to be considered as the
response patterns appear to be different. For lymphomas, modified Lugano criteria have been
proposed with the establishment of lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria
(LYRIC) [69]. Comparable to the category "unconfirmed progressive disease" used for solid
tumors by iRECIST and iPERCIST, LYRIC has introduced the category “indeterminate
response” (IR) when an increase in tumor burden, new lesions, and/or increased 18F-FDG
uptake is observed with subsequent imaging within 12 weeks, which is recommended to confirm
the true disease progression versus pseudoprogression. However, concerning Hodgkin
lymphoma, the contribution of LYRIC compared to the standard Lugano classification seems
limited, because pseudo progressions seem very rare in this disease. Thus, no pseudoprogression
was reported in the two studies, including a total of 60 patients with refractory or relapsed
Hodgkin lymphoma treated with immunotherapy and having an early therapeutic evaluation (2 to
3 months) by 18F-FDG PET/CT. Moreover, in a retrospective multicentric study including 45
patients with Hodgkin lymphoma treated by nivolumab, the classification at the 18F-FDG PET
performed at 2.0 months (interquartile range: 1.7–3.7 months) was identical between Lugano
criteria and LYRIC, since all 16 progression events on this examination classified as an
indeterminate response per LYRIC were confirmed as progressive diseases on subsequent
evaluations. In most other types of lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B
cell lymphoma, ICIs have been rarely used to date, because they are less effective, and therefore,
there is a lack of data regarding their therapeutic evaluation.
5.4 Hyper Progression Disease and Early Therapeutic Response Evaluation
Hyperprogression disease is an acceleration of the tumor growth rate (TGR) with a
∆TGR (variation of TGR per month) exceeding 50% at the first evaluation compared to
pretreatment kinetics. This phenomenon is quite common for patients treated with ICI, as it was
observed in 7% (12 of 189) patients with solid tumors and is associated with high metastatic
burden and poor prognosis.
As hyper progression disease drives toward early death, notably when it occurs in the
first 6 weeks of treatment, the anticipated first radiological evaluation during PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitor treatment, including 18F-FDG PET/CT, has to be discussed in order to identify them
[74].
18F-FDG PET/CT performed early after the initiation of immunotherapy could not only
detect hyper progression but also participate in the therapeutic evaluation, notably by detecting
early responders and non-responders more easily than with CT. Therefore, in a study with 24
patients with NSCLC treated by nivolumab, metabolic responses determined by 18F–FDG PET
at 1 month (especially total lesion glycolysis, TLG, which is the product of the TMTV and the
mean SUV) were closely associated with therapeutic response and survival, while it was difficult
to distinguish between responders and non-responders on morphological changes on CT scans.
In another pilot prospective study of 10 patients with unresectable metastasized melanoma, the
responding patients could be reliably identified as early as two weeks after the start of the
therapy, which was consistent with the usual early metabolic response, compared to the generally
later anatomical response.
Interim evaluation, performed after the first two cycles of immunotherapy, is also
possible with interesting results, as was shown in a population of 41 patients with unresectable
metastatic melanoma treated by ipilimumab. The PERCIMT classification showed a sensitivity
of 93.6%, a specificity of 70.0%, and an accuracy of 87.8% to predict clinical benefit—including
stable disease, partial response, and complete response (31 patients)—and those showing no
clinical benefit including progressive disease (10 patients) according to the best clinical response
of patients, which was assessed at a median of 21 months.
5.5 Abscopal Effect:
Radiation therapy can induce the death of cancer cells and can activate the immune
system. The abscopal effect is a tumor regression observed in metastases distant from the local
treatment site, such as the primary irradiation site. The combination of radiotherapy and
immunotherapy can have the advantage of controlling disease locally with potential systemic and
lasting immune effects. PET/CT can observe such responses, even if, until now, only case reports
have been reported.\\

\noindent \textbf{\large Diagnosis of Side Effects in Nuclear Medicine Imaging
:} \\\\The physiological objective of CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1 is the blockade of auto immune
responses. When these pathways are inhibited, T-cell inflammatory responses can be triggered to
target cancer; however, they also target some healthy tissues. The attacks on healthy tissue can
generate immune-related adverse events (IrAE), the scope of which is large and the gravity of
which, though generally low, can be severe (around 10% patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1
experienced severe IrAEs) and even potentially life threatening if not diagnosed and treated.
Therefore, the permanent discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitors is advised in patients
with high-grade ocular, hepatic, pancreatic and/or pulmonary IrAEs. IrAEs are generally detected
by clinicians, but medical imaging can help to find early signs of unknown IrAEs, with
radiologically evident IrAEs reported in up to approximately 30% of patients. Moreover, to avoid
errors in therapeutic evaluation, these IrAEs have to be differentiated from active cancerous
disease, notably from metastatic progression. Figure 5 resumes the discoverability by 18F-FDG
PET/CT of different IrAEs.
The below figure is Summary diagram of the different immune-related adverse events. The
nuclear symbol represents the side effects that can be visualized by 18F-FDG PET/CT
\\

\\\\
In a monocentric retrospective study with the objective of describing the IrAE
characteristics on medical imaging and their detection rate, Mekki et al. found 39 (74%)
abnormal medical imaging findings on 53 patients who had a co-occurrence of irAEs and
medical imaging (CT, PET/CT, MRI, US of radiography) within 15 days. Among the 12
performed 18F-FDG PET/CT, 10 (83%) were abnormal with thoracic sarcoid-like reaction,
enterocolitis, thyroiditis, hypophysitis, and pancreatitis.
Regardless of their severity, the occurrence of an IrAE could also be linked to the
therapeutic response by revealing the immune response. In a study of 41 patients with metastatic
melanoma treated by anti-CTLA-4 (iplimumab), four patients among the 31 having disease
control had a sarcoid-like meidiastino-hilar lymphadenopathy diagnosed on the follow-up
18FDG PET/CT, while the side effect was not observed on the 10 patients having progressive
disease. The same team performed a study on 16 patients with BRAF-mutation positive
metastatic melanoma treated by a combination of vemurafenib and ipilimumab with longitudinal
18FDG-PET/CT for the follow up. Seven patients developed imaging signs on PET/CT of at
least one immune-related adverse event, with colitis and arthritis being the most frequent
ones(five and four events, respectively), and these patients had a significantly longer
progression-free survival than those without irAEs(p=0.036). Another team found concordant
results on a retrospective study of 40 patients with three types of cancer (malignant melanoma,
malignant lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma) treated by ICI’s and followed by 18F-FDG
PET/CT. They found that a PET-detectable immune-related adverse event indicated a favorable
outcome (nine of 11 patients with IrAE had complete response at final evaluation) with in
particular thyroiditis, which was seen earlier than other IRAE and could provide an early
indicator of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Therefore, immune-related inflammation has to be
reported even if they are not necessarily associated with clinically significant IrAE. Illustrations
of 18F-FDG PET-detectable immune-related adverse effects are presented in several articles
[85,88,90].
Another early sign of immune activity is an inversion of the liver-to-spleen ratio
(normally >1), possibly by reflecting the immune activation preceding T cell proliferation, but
also the reactive nodes in the drainage basin of the primary tumor, which could be wrongly
diagnosed as cancerous lymph nodes (Figure).
Finally, if immune checkpoint inhibitors do not promote infections, immune-related
adverse effects often require immunosuppressive treatment, which in turn increases the risk of
developing serious infections, and such infections can be observed on imaging.
 \\ \\

\\ \\ \noindent \textbf{\large End-of-Treatment Assessment:} \\ \\ 18F-FDG PET imaging may also help better predict long-term outcomes compared to
standard computed tomography (CT) response criteria. Therefore, a team has shown in a
retrospective study of 104 patients with melanoma, who received anti-PD-1 as monotherapy
(67%) or combined with ipilimumab (31%), that while only a small proportion of patients had a
complete response at 1 year on CT (28%), most patients with a partial response on CT have a
complete metabolic response on PET (68% of the 66% having a partial response). Moreover,
almost all patients with complete metabolic response on PET at 1 year had ongoing response to
therapy thereafter (78% had discontinued treatment and 96% had ongoing response). 18F-FDG
PET could help to decide on the continuation/discontinuation of therapy, notably when durable
response is observed.\\ \\

\noindent \textbf{\large Conclusion:} \\ \\ In this systematic review, we have observed that immune checkpoint inhibitors have a
major impact on nuclear medicine imaging with changes in its interpretation, including the
consideration of induced inflammation by new therapeutic evaluation criteria.
New perspectives are also emerging, with a central role for nuclear medicine being the
prediction of the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, notably by the use of new
radiotracers, such as immuno-PET, or new analysis techniques, including radiomics and body
composition analyses.
